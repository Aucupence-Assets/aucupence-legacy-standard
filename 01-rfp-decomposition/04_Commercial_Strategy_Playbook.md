# Commercial Strategy Playbook – Enterprise RFPs

This playbook is used to decide how we price and position our proposal once we have a basic understanding of scope, risk and context.

It is not a rate card. It is a set of patterns for aligning risk with commercial model.

## 1. Core Principles

1. Protect delivery quality: we do not accept pricing structures that make quality impossible.
2. Make risk visible: if we are absorbing risk, it must be priced and explicitly documented.
3. Prefer simplicity where possible: fewer models and exceptions reduce friction and billing disputes.
4. Separate build from run: different risk profiles require different commercial treatment.

## 2. Typical Pricing Patterns

### Pattern A – Discovery Then Fixed Packages

Use when:
- Requirements are incomplete.
- There is willingness to invest in discovery.

Structure:
- Time & Materials discovery phase (4–8 weeks).
- Output: backlog, NFR profile, integration catalogue, risk register.
- After discovery: identify stable work packages that can be priced as fixed fee.

Benefits:
- Client gets visibility before committing to a large fixed price.
- We avoid over-padding for unknowns.

### Pattern B – Mixed Fixed Price and T&M

Use when:
- Core scope is clear, but integrations, data or regulatory approvals remain uncertain.

Structure:
- Stable features (channels, basic services) on fixed price with clear acceptance criteria.
- High-uncertainty items on T&M or capped T&M.
- Separate commercial treatment for change requests.

Benefits:
- Protects both sides from scope creep.
- Keeps headline budget manageable while preserving flexibility.

### Pattern C – Capacity-based Model

Use when:
- Client has a continuous roadmap.
- Product ownership is strong and backlog is expected to evolve.

Structure:
- Dedicated team (for example 8–12 FTE) for a minimum term.
- One or a small set of blended rates.
- Regular reviews of throughput and scope.

Benefits:
- High transparency and flexibility.
- Good fit for product-centric organisations.

## 3. Negotiation Levers

### 3.1 Scope and Phasing

- Offer a reduced MVP scope for earlier go-live and lower initial budget.
- Postpone complex or low-value items to later phases.
- Use feature flags to de-risk production rollout.

### 3.2 Assumptions and Change Control

- Document key assumptions explicitly (data quality, API stability, client resourcing).
- Link each assumption to a clear change control trigger.
- Avoid vague “all inclusive” wording; prefer traced assumptions and impacts.

### 3.3 Risk Sharing

- For hard regulatory deadlines, propose shared risk:
  - We commit capacity and prioritisation.
  - Client commits to timely decisions and access to stakeholders.
- For third-party dependency risk, clarify:
  - Who owns the relationship and remediation with providers.
  - How delays or quality issues translate into timeline and cost.

### 3.4 Discount Logic

We avoid arbitrary headline discounts that later force low-quality staffing.

We consider:
- Volume commitment (minimum annual spend).
- Contract duration and renewal options.
- Simplified contract administration (fewer rate categories, predictable invoicing).
- Joint marketing or case-study value, subject to client approval.

Discounts are always tied to something concrete:
- Predictable volume.
- Longer-term collaboration.
- Reduced overhead for both sides.

## 4. Red Lines

We document “no-go” conditions up front, such as:
- Unlimited liability for indirect or consequential loss.
- Fixed price on a large, evolving scope without discovery and assumptions.
- Penalty regimes that exceed reasonable margins and jeopardize delivery quality.

If an RFP insists on such conditions, we either:
- Propose alternatives in our response, or
- Decide not to bid.

# Module 01 – RFP Decomposition & Bid Strategy

This module provides enterprise-grade artifacts for decomposing complex RFPs into scorable compliance sections and defensible delivery plans.

Core assets include:
- Bid triage criteria that separate strategic fit, delivery risk and commercial exposure.
- Advanced compliance matrices aligned to regulated banking and public-sector expectations.
- Clarification question libraries that surface hidden scope and non-functional constraints.
- Commercial strategy playbooks to position smaller vendors against Tier-1 competitors.

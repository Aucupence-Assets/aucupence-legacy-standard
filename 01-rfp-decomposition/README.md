# 01 – RFP Decomposition and Bid Strategy

This module captures how we handle complex enterprise RFPs as a vendor-side partner, not as a document writer.

It is used when:
- Deciding whether to bid, and under what conditions.
- Decomposing a banking / payments / regulated-industry RFP into internal workstreams.
- Building a traceable compliance view that legal, finance, security and delivery can all work from.
- Designing a commercial and negotiation strategy that matches risk and effort.

Contents:

- 02_Compliance_Matrix_Banking_Advanced.md  
  Enterprise-grade compliance view for banking / payments RFPs.
- 03_RFP_Clarification_Questions.md  
  Clarification questions we always ask before committing to a binding proposal.
- 04_Commercial_Strategy_Playbook.md  
  How we combine pricing models, scope slicing and contractual levers.

This folder is intentionally technology-neutral. It focuses on:
- Vendor-side governance and decision logic.
- How to protect delivery quality and margin in high-pressure bids.
- How to be transparent about gaps without losing credibility.

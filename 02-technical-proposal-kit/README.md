# Module 02 – Technical Proposal Kit

This module contains reusable baselines for architecture and NFR responses used in proposal-stage documentation.

The content emphasises:
- Multi-view solution framing (logical, integration, data, security, operability).
- Audit-ready NFR narratives with measurable targets and negotiable assumptions.
- Cloud and DevSecOps language sufficient for technical scoring without exposing proprietary implementation.

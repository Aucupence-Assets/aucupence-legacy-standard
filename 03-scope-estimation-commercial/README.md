# Module 03 – Estimation & Commercial Framing

This module shows how we translate early-stage requirements into defensible effort ranges and commercial structures.

It includes:
- Workstream-based estimation patterns.
- Driver-based effort assumptions.
- Role-mix and rate-card narratives.
- Scope-and-change clauses suitable for enterprise procurement review.

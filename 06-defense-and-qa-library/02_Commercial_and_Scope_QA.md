# Presales Commercial & Scope Q&A – Standard Library

This library is used when procurement or senior stakeholders challenge the commercial model, pricing level or scope discipline.

## 1. Scope & Change Control

**Question:** Why do you insist on a formal change-control process?

**Answer:**  
Complex digital projects evolve over time. Without a clear mechanism to manage changes, both parties risk misaligned expectations and hidden cost. A structured change process protects the customer and the vendor by making the impact of each change visible and agreed:

- We document the requested change in simple language,
- We assess impact on effort, timeline and risk,
- We present options (do now, defer, or decline),
- We only proceed once the option and impact are approved.

This avoids “silent” scope creep and keeps the commercial model transparent to governance and audit.

## 2. Fixed Price vs Time & Materials

**Question:** Can you deliver this entire scope on a fixed price?

**Answer:**  
Fixed price is feasible when requirements are stable and clearly defined. When key assumptions are still open, we normally propose:

1. A **discovery phase** on Time & Materials to converge on a baseline (requirements, architecture, NFRs, interfaces).  
2. After discovery, we convert well-understood workstreams into fixed price with:
   - Clear acceptance criteria,
   - Explicit assumptions and exclusions,
   - Defined change-control rules.

This creates a mixed model: fixed price where risk is manageable, T&M where scope is still moving or heavily dependent on third parties.

## 3. “Your Day Rates Look High”

**Question:** Your rates seem higher than some competitors. Why?

**Answer:**  
We typically explain three levers:

- **Productivity and composition of the team** – we use a smaller, more senior core with clear ownership, supported by standardised tooling and automation.  
- **Embedded governance and quality** – our commercial model already includes architecture, QA and delivery-governance effort; they are not optional extras.  
- **Risk profile** – we price to deliver reliably in a regulated environment rather than to win only on headline rate.

Where useful, we offer to compare *scenario totals* (for example, cost to reach a credible go-live) instead of isolated day rates.

## 4. Blended Rates vs Role-Based Rates

**Question:** Can you give us a single blended rate instead of a detailed rate card?

**Answer:**  
For planning purposes we often provide a high-level blended rate. However, for governance and transparency we keep the underlying role-based rate card:

- The blended rate is useful for high-level budgeting and benchmarking,  
- The role-based view is needed for audits, unit-rate comparisons and change requests.

We are happy to work with either format, as long as the underlying structure and assumptions remain traceable.

## 5. Handling Scope Reductions and Cost Pressure

**Question:** If our budget is lower than your proposal, what can we do?

**Answer:**  
Instead of simply cutting rates, we normally explore:

- **Scope trade-offs** – remove or de-scope lower-value features, or move them to a later phase.  
- **Quality of non-functionals** – adjust some NFR targets where they drive disproportionate cost, while staying within regulatory and business constraints.  
- **Delivery model adjustments** – modify onshore / offshore mix or cadence, without compromising key governance roles.

This makes it explicit *what changes* when budget changes, so that executives understand the trade-off instead of assuming “same scope for less”.

## 6. Overruns and Accountability

**Question:** What happens if you overrun the agreed effort?

**Answer:**  
We separate **estimation error** from **client-driven change**:

- If the work is within agreed scope and the overrun is due to our underestimation, we expect to absorb some or all of that impact.  
- If the overrun is driven by new requirements, third-party delays or scope changes, we expect that to be visible in the change-control log and reflected in commercials.

This principle is discussed up front so that, when issues occur, both sides can refer back to a shared understanding rather than renegotiating basics under pressure.

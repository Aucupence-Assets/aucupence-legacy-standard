## Scope & Change Control

**Question**: Why do you insist on a formal change control process?

**Answer**:  
Complex digital projects evolve over time. Without a clear mechanism to manage changes, both parties risk misaligned expectations and hidden cost. A structured change process protects the customer and the vendor by making the impact of each change visible and agreed.

## Fixed Price vs. Time & Materials

**Question**: Can you deliver this entire scope on a fixed price?

**Answer**:  
Fixed price is feasible when requirements are stable and clearly defined. When key assumptions are still open, we normally propose a discovery phase on Time & Materials to converge on a baseline. After that, portions of scope can be converted to fixed price with clear acceptance criteria.

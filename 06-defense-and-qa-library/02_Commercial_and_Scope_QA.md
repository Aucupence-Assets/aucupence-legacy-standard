# Presales Commercial & Scope Q&A – Standard Library

---

## Scope and Change

**Q1**: Why do you insist on formal change control?  
**A**: Enterprise programs evolve. A structured CR process protects both parties by making impact visible, agreed and traceable.

**Q2**: How do you distinguish estimation error from client-driven change?  
**A**: We baseline assumptions and integration readiness at bid stage. Variance within baseline is treated as vendor risk; variance driven by new requirements or dependency shifts is treated as change.

**Q3**: What is your position on scope freeze?  
**A**: We support scope stabilization after discovery with defined acceptance criteria and a lightweight governance path for exceptions.

## Pricing Models

**Q4**: Can you deliver everything on fixed price?  
**A**: Fixed price is feasible once requirements, integrations and NFR constraints are stable. We propose discovery on T&M, then convert defined workstreams to FP with explicit assumptions.

**Q5**: How do you avoid “hidden change” in FP contracts?  
**A**: We attach a structured assumptions register and a mutual dependency log to the contract baseline.

**Q6**: Do you offer hybrid models?  
**A**: Yes. Discovery, data migration and high-uncertainty integration may remain T&M while core build sprints are priced as FP with change thresholds.

## Rate Cards and Role Mix

**Q7**: How do you justify blended rates to procurement?  
**A**: We disclose role mix by workstream, explain governance overhead, and tie senior roles to risk reduction rather than volume.

**Q8**: Why do you allocate an onshore architect if most build is offshore?  
**A**: The onshore architect reduces audit and decision latency and serves as design authority for regulated stakeholders.

## TCO and Value

**Q9**: How do you address total cost of ownership?  
**A**: We discuss build vs run separation, NFR impact on infra and licensing, and the cost reduction effect of automation and quality gates.

**Q10**: Can you link fees to outcomes?  
**A**: We consider limited outcome components when KPIs and measurement methods are mutually agreed and controllable by both parties.

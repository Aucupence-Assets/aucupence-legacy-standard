# PM Enablement Topics – Talking to International Clients

This document outlines topics used when coaching project managers and tech leads who work with international clients in English.

## 1. Explaining the Delivery Model

PMs should be able to clearly explain:

- How the onshore / nearshore / offshore split works.
- Which roles are in which time zones and who owns what decisions.
- How handovers work across time zones and how issues are followed up across shifts.

Example phrase:  
"Your product owner remains in full control of scope and priorities. Our offshore team focuses on implementation, with a named onshore architect and PM ensuring that decisions and risks are transparent."

## 2. Discussing Scope and Change

Instead of saying "this is more work," PMs should be trained to:

- Refer back to the originally agreed scope baseline.
- Explain which aspects are new, unclear or conflicting.
- Offer options: de-scope, extend timeline, or add budget.

Example phrase:  
"Compared to the baseline we agreed in March, this new requirement introduces an additional integration and two new user journeys. We see three options: adjust the date, adjust the budget, or simplify the requirement."

## 3. Defending Estimation Logic

PMs must avoid excuses like "the team underestimated." Instead they should:

- Explain estimation drivers (number of integrations, data quality, regulatory constraints).
- Describe how they use historical velocity and three-point estimates.
- Show what has changed since the initial estimate.

Example phrase:  
"The main driver of effort here is the quality and availability of the external APIs. When we estimated in January, we assumed stable sandbox access. Since then, the provider has changed their API twice. We can either stabilize against the current version or keep time in the plan for future changes."

## 4. Talking about Risk and Mitigation

Coaching focuses on helping PMs articulate risks clearly:

- What might happen.
- How likely it is.
- What mitigation is in place.
- What support is needed from the client.

Example phrase:  
"There is a moderate risk that data migration will take longer than expected if we find inconsistent records. Our mitigation is to run an early profiling exercise. To make this effective, we need access to a realistic sample dataset this month."

## 5. Handling Technical Questions without Being a Deep Technician

Many PMs are not deep engineers but still need to answer high-level architecture questions. Training helps them:

- Recognize which questions they can answer at a conceptual level.
- Know when to involve a solution architect.
- Use consistent language to describe the solution (layers, domains, interfaces).

Example phrase:  
"At a high level, the solution is layered: channels, APIs, domain services and data. For detailed performance numbers, I suggest we bring our architect to the next session, but the important point is that we designed it to scale horizontally rather than vertically."

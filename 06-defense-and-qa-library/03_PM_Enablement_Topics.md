# PM Enablement Topics – Extended Library

This document describes the areas we focus on when coaching project managers and tech leads who interact with international clients. It is not a training course description but a working playbook used in sessions.

---

## 1. Explaining the Delivery Model Clearly

Objectives:

- PM can describe how the overall delivery model works in two minutes.
- Client understands who does what, where and when.

We practice:

- Explaining onshore / nearshore / offshore splits,
- Describing roles and responsibilities without jargon,
- Using simple visuals (layers, teams, flows) to anchor the explanation.

Example phrasing:  
“Our delivery is structured around one product owner on your side and one project manager on ours. Core development happens in our offshore team, with an onshore architect and PM acting as your primary contact and decision bridge.”

---

## 2. Talking About Scope and Baselines

Objectives:

- PM uses the concept of a baseline when discussing scope.
- Changes are framed relative to that baseline, not as surprises.

We practice:

- Referencing signed-off backlogs or specifications,
- Explaining why a new request is inside or outside that baseline,
- Suggesting concrete options instead of simply saying “out of scope”.

Example phrasing:  
“Compared to the scope we agreed at the end of Inception, this request adds one new integration and extends two existing journeys. To keep the same target date, we would need to de-scope something of similar size or accept a change in timeline.”

## 3. Defending Estimation in Business Language

Objectives:

- PM explains effort drivers without hiding behind technical detail.
- Client sees that estimates are structured, not guesses.

We practice:

- Breaking effort down into drivers (integrations, complexity, data quality),
- Using ranges and confidence levels appropriately,
- Explaining why certain items carry more contingency.

Example phrasing:  
“The key driver of effort here is the number of external systems and how stable their APIs are. If those interfaces change often, we keep more contingency; if they are stable and well-documented, the estimate can be tighter.”

---

## 4. Communicating Risks and Dependencies

Objectives:

- PM can articulate risks in a structured way and ask for help clearly.
- Risk discussions are regular and unemotional.

We practice:

- Expressing risk as: cause, event, impact, likelihood and mitigation,
- Separating delivery risks from business or decision risks,
- Asking for specific client actions to reduce risk.

Example phrasing:  
“There is a high risk that data migration will delay go-live if we discover inconsistent legacy records. Our mitigation is to run profiling on a realistic sample this month. To do that, we need your team to provide that sample and a contact person for clarifications.”

---

## 5. Handling Difficult Conversations on Delays

Objectives:

- PM can talk about delays without being defensive,
- Conversations focus on facts and options.

We practice:

- Explaining root causes briefly and objectively,
- Showing what has already been done to recover,
- Presenting two or three options with pros and cons.

Example phrasing:  
“We are currently one sprint behind the original plan. The main reasons are the unplanned changes in the KYC API and the time needed to stabilise the new test environment. We see three realistic options: move the launch by two weeks, reduce the scope for day one, or add two developers to the core team for the next three sprints.”

---

## 6. Running Effective Status Calls in English

Objectives:

- Status calls are concise and action-focused.
- Client leaves knowing what has happened, what is blocked and what is needed from them.

We practice:

- Structuring updates into ‘completed, in progress, at risk, next steps’,
- Keeping technical detail at the right level for the audience,
- Ending each call with clear actions and owners.

Example opening:  
“Today I will cover three things: what we completed since last week, the two items that are at risk, and the decisions we need from you to keep the plan on track.”

---

## 7. Writing Clear Client Emails

Objectives:

- Written communication is simple, polite and to the point.
- Decisions and actions are clearly documented.

We practice:

- Short, structured emails with a clear subject,
- Summarising decisions and next steps after key meetings,
- Escalating issues in writing when necessary.

Practical patterns:

- “Decision summary” emails after workshops,  
- “Risk escalation” emails with context, impact and proposed mitigation,  
- “Change confirmation” emails when scope adjustments are agreed verbally.

---

## 8. Coordinating Across Time Zones

Objectives:

- Handovers are predictable and documented.
- Issues do not fall between time zones.

We practice:

- Using shared tools (boards, ticket systems) to record status,
- Creating short, written handover notes between shifts,
- Agreeing windows for live overlap and decision-making.

Example phrasing:  
“We will use our daily overlap window between 10:00 and 12:00 your time for decisions and clarifications. Outside that, our team will continue implementation and leave structured questions in the board for your review.”

---

## 9. Handling Technical Questions Without Overstretching

Objectives:

- PM knows where their line is and when to bring in an architect.
- The client still feels their question was taken seriously.

We practice:

- Giving a high-level answer where appropriate,
- Proposing a follow-up with the right specialist,
- Capturing the question accurately instead of guessing.

Example phrasing:  
“At a high level, the solution is event-driven: changes in the core system publish events that the lending engine reacts to. For specific throughput numbers and sizing we should have our architect join; I will set up a short technical session and send you a proposal for the agenda.”

---

## 10. Recognising and Avoiding Anti-Patterns

Objectives:

- PM becomes aware of typical behaviours that erode trust.
- We build alternative patterns that preserve transparency.

Anti-patterns we discuss:

- Over-promising in meetings and renegotiating later,
- Hiding risks or delays until deadlines are close,
- Blaming “the offshore team” instead of focusing on facts,
- Using jargon to mask uncertainty.

For each, we design a healthier alternative behaviour and practice it with role plays.

This playbook is used as a reference during coaching sessions. We typically select a subset of topics based on the individual’s role, experience and upcoming client situations.

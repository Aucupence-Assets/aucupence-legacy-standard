# Aucupence Legacy Standard – Presales, Governance & Enablement Asset Library

Status: Archived snapshot. This repository represents a legacy internal baseline used for:
- Presales support for software vendors and outsourcing teams,
- Proposal and RFP response work,
- Delivery governance design,
- And enablement/coaching of project managers and tech leads.

This repository is not a product. It is a curated set of working templates, reference checklists and example narratives that show how a small consulting team structures:

- Complex RFP responses for regulated industries (e.g. banking, payments, public sector),
- Non-functional requirement (NFR) responses for cloud-native architectures,
- Estimation logic and commercial defense for offshore/nearshore delivery models,
- Governance and quality frameworks that can be understood and audited by international clients,
- Talking points and defense scripts used in presales Q&A and steering committees.

The same assets are frequently reused in training and coaching sessions with:
- Delivery teams from outsourcing vendors that need to communicate with European or global clients,
- Project managers and tech leads who must explain their delivery model, estimation logic and risk posture in English,
- Individual professionals preparing for project-management and digital-banking roles.

No client-identifying information is included. All examples are generic and technology-agnostic enough to be safely reused as baseline material.

## Structure

   Standard non-functional requirement responses, architecture notes and solution overviews for digital lending and transaction-heavy systems.

3. 03-scope-estimation-commercial  
   Effort estimation models, role descriptions, rate-card structures and commercial defense language tailored to offshore/nearshore delivery.

4. 04-plan-level-delivery-governance  
   Delivery governance models, phase plans, milestone definitions and steering-committee structures used in transformation programs.

5. 05-quality-and-test-strategy  
   Test strategies, QA governance, defect SLAs and quality reporting baselines that can be plugged into regulated-client environments.

6. 06-defense-and-qa-library  
   Presales technical and commercial Q&A narratives, as well as enablement topics for PMs and tech leads who need to defend their projects to demanding clients.

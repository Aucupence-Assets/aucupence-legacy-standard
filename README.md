# Aucupence Legacy Standard – Presales, Governance & Enablement Asset Library

Status: Archived snapshot of a legacy internal baseline used to support software vendors and delivery teams in proposal-stage governance and capability articulation.

This repository is a curated set of templates and reference narratives that demonstrate how a small consulting team structures:

- Enterprise RFP decomposition and bid triage for regulated environments.
- NFR and solution-overview responses for digital platforms with high audit and availability expectations.
- Estimation logic, role-mix assumptions and commercial defense for offshore/nearshore delivery.
- Delivery governance, quality gates and operational readiness patterns that international clients can review and score.
- Presales and enablement Q&A used to prepare PMs, tech leads and architects for demanding client challenges.

The same assets are reused in:
- Vendor enablement for outsourcing teams facing global client standards.
- Coaching project managers and tech leads who must defend delivery models and risk posture in English.
- Individual role-focused training for digital banking and transformation-related positions.

No client-identifying information is included. Examples are abstracted and safe for baseline reuse.

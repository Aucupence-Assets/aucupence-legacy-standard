# ADR-001 – Example Architecture Decision Record

## Context

This repository is a static snapshot intended to demonstrate how architectural decisions can be recorded and maintained.

## Decision

We use lightweight markdown-based ADRs stored in version control. Each significant design choice is captured with context, decision and consequences.

## Consequences

- Architectural knowledge remains close to the code.
- New team members can review the decision history without relying solely on oral knowledge transfer.
